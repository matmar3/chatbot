    "description": "Lednice's massive neo-Gothic chateau, owned by the Liechtenstein family from 1582 to 1945, is one of the country's most popular weekend destinations. The crowds come for the splendid interiors and extensive gardens, complete with an exotic-plant greenhouse, lakes with pleasure boats, and a mock Turkish minaret architectural excess for the 19th-century nobility.
