    "description": "Hluboka Chateau was built by Premysl rulers in the 13th century and the building changed ownership several times until it landed in the hands of the Schwarzenberg noble family in the 17th century. They gave the castle its English Tudor makeover, modelled on Britain's Windsor Castle, in 1871, adding turrets, towers, crenellations and sumptuous wood-panelled interiors. The chateau's extensive landscaped gardens are open daily year-round, free of charge. Entry to the chateau is by guided tour only. ",
