    "description": "Prague's family-friendly National Technical Museum got a high-tech renovation in 2012 and is a dazzling presentation of the country's industrial heritage. The exhibits here are anything but dull. Start in the main hall, filled to the rafters with historic planes, trains and automobiles. There are separate halls devoted to displays on astronomy, photography, printing and architecture. ",
