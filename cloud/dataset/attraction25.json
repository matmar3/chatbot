    "description": "Cesky Krumlov, a town featuring a large Bohemian Castle resides in the region of Krumlov. It was created in the late thirteenth century, when the region was owned by the Bohemians, as a trade stronghold. The location along a natural crossing of the Vltava river made it a perfect place to build. The town's appearance is little changed since the 18th century and the buildings have been well maintained and restored. It is a lovely castle city that still has the look and feel of a Medieval town. Crooked cobblestone streets and brightly-colored stucco facades make Cesky Krumlov beautiful and unique. The streets are full of interesting shops, succulent food, and timeless charm.",
