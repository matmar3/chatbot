    "description": "The village's impressive castle was built on the site of an earlier Romanesque fort, of which the only surviving bits are the tall square tower, and fragments of a rotunda and palace. Its present late-Gothic look dates from the 14th century. Visits are normally by guided tour, though you can opt to walk around on your own with English text. Exhibitions include Gothic murals, a gruesome tableaux of torture instruments, and two rooms full of luscious locally produced ceramics. ",
