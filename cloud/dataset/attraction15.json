    "description": "The town's main museum is spread out over two buildings and explores the rise of Nazism and life in the Terezin ghetto. The main building once housed a school; haunting images painted by the students still decorate the walls. A second building, the former Magdeburg Barracks (Tyrlova 204), is located 200m south. This served as the seat of the Jewish town council'. Visit a reconstructed dormitory and see exhibits on cultural life that somehow flourished against the backdrop of fear. ",
