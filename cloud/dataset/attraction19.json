    "description": "Lovely Letna Gardens occupies a bluff over the Vltava River, north of the Old Town, and has postcard-perfect views out over the city, river, and bridges. It's ideal for walking, jogging and drinking at a popular beer garden at the eastern end of the park. From the Old Town, find the entrance up a steep staircase at the northern end of Pacoske ulice (across the bridge). Alternatively, take the tram to Letenske namesti and walk south for about 10 minutes. ",
