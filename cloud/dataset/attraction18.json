    "description": "Znojmo's labyrinth of underground corridors below the old town is one of the most extensive in Central Europe, snaking around for some 27km. Two types of guided tours are offered: the 'classic' tour is designed for families and features fairy-tale characters; the 'adrenaline' tour is more hardcore and involves actually climbing walls and crawling through tunnels.",
